    "title": "Kawagoe Tsukemen at Ganja: A Refined Take on Dipping Ramen",
    "content": "When people think of Kawagoe tsukemen, Ganja (頑者) is a name that always comes up. This long-standing shop is one of the most famous tsukemen (dipping ramen) shops in Saitama Prefecture - and in all of Japan.\n\nThey were pioneers in the second-wave tsukemen craze, known for heavier soups that influenced countless other shops. Today, their recipe (updated in 2018) has evolved into something more balanced and refined without losing its roots.\n\nGanja’s broth is built on pork bones, chicken bones, and fish. There are certainly fish notes present, but the soup doesn’t go overboard. Instead, it’s gentle and layered, with a creaminess from the pork and chicken bones that ties everything together.\n\nCompared to many tsukemen broths, this one is less salty, less sour, and not overly thick, making it easy to keep dipping until the very end.\n\nThe broth also carries a pleasant sweetness, in part thanks to a generous amount of negi (spring onions), which adds depth and brightness. They serve a spicy version too!\n\nTsukemen noodles are always the star of the show, and Ganja doesn’t disappoint. Their thick, water-rich noodles are chewy, slippery, and perfectly designed to cling to the broth.\n\nThe noodles’ offer a refreshing texture against the mild, nuanced soup.\n\nWhile some tsukemen bowls can feel like a full-on flavor assault, Ganja’s Kawagoe tsukemen is all about balance and restraint. It’s milder than the richer, saltier tsukemen you might be used to, but no less delicious. And for a little extra fun? They close at 4:20 PM sharp every day.\n\nIf you’re in Kawagoe and want a dipping ramen experience that’s both historic and deeply comforting, Ganja is a must-visit.",

    "content": "Men-ya Inoichi Hanare (麺屋 猪一 離れ) in Kyoto serves ramen with a big salute from Michelin. They're most famous for a delicately arranged tsukemen (dipping ramen).\n\nAs of 2022, Michelin has recognized nine Kyoto ramen shops in their Bib Gourmand Guide. Men-ya Inoichi Hanare is one of them. They'e centrally located in Kyoto, with Shijo the closest station.\n\nThe convenient location and nod from Michelin understandably has made it popular with tourists. It therefore pays to visit outside of peak hours (avoid 12 pm - 1:30 pm).\n\nMen-ya Inoichi Hanare carries multiple types of ramen. But the tsukemen (dipping ramen) is what they're most proud of. In many ways, it's a powerful culinary representation of Kyoto. The soup is lightly seasoned with shiro shoyu (white soy sauce).\n\nIt has an overall gentle flavor, with sweetness coming from an abundance of negi (spring onions) and ginger. Parallel to this sweetness is the strong presence of dashi. The dashi includes high-grade Rausu kelp and several types of dried fish.\n\nThe subtle fish flavors are heightened by the pile of katsuobushi (shaved bonito fish flakes) on top of the soup. But there's a lot hiding beneath the surface as well.\n\nAmong toppings in the soup, the thin slices of pork are a big highlight. The pork is the local \"Kyonoto Mochi Buta\" brand.\n\nThe dipping noodles are thick and slippery. They come with a side of sea salt and sudachi (a citrus fruit) to add a little zing to the noodles.\n\nLastly, there's shredded kelp (konbu), which can be added as a soup condiment. I'd recommend only putting them in at the end. The shredded kelp bits are tasty. But they really increase the soup's salinity.\n\nMen-ya Inoichi Hanare is unlike other Kyoto ramen shops. That is, most Kyoto ramen is actually quite heavy. This said, I appreciate how they're different from their peers.\n\nThey have made a clear commitment to dashi and showcasing the delicate side of Kyoto cuisine.\n\nAre there any cons? Perhaps it's just that they're overhyped. The 4.5+ Google review scores means that most customers are tourists. So waiting times can be long.\n\nRegardless, they are a quality option for ramen (tsukemen) in Kyoto. Just make sure to visit outside of peak hours.",

    "content": "Ramen Iida Shoten (らぁ麺飯田商店) is Japan's no. 1 ranked ramen shop! It's popular to the point that it's tough to get a reservation. But I got lucky on the third try.\n\nThis is an in-depth breakdown of what many consider to be Japan's BEST ramen shop.\n\nIn the past, you'd have to visit Iida Shoten early in the morning to reserve a spot for lunch. But now they take reservations exclusively on booking platform Omakase.\n\nWhile this eliminates the need to wake up early, reserving isn't exactly easy. The booking window is just once a week and all seats normally go within 5 minutes. This said, I was elated when I got a reservation. This was after three consecutive weeks of trying.\n\nIida Shoten is no. 1 in Japan on several local websites, including Tabelog and Ramen Database. With this understanding, the expectations were certainly high when I visited.\n\nThey're located in Yugawara, Kanagawa prefecture. This is South of Tokyo and a bit over an hour on a fast train.\n\nEveryone tries the shoyu (soy sauce) ramen. The recipe has changed several times, with masterchef Iida-san making tweaks every so often. The latest rendition is impressive. An organic koikuchi (dark) shoyu from Hyogo anchors the ship.\n\nAn usukuchi (light) shoyu from Tatsuno, Hyogo serves as a sidekick. These two shoyu are combined with a koikuchi one from Wakayama and an aged one from Aichi. This shoyu quartet generates a sweet, sour, and fairly salty base.\n\nThis base carries a soup concentrated on whole chickens and chicken bones. They use only the finest chicken breeds from around Japan. This includes Kurosatsuma from Kagoshima, Hinai Jidori, Nagoya Cochin, and Sansui Jidori.\n\nThe soup also includes pork meat and bones (trotters and back). They're just as high-grade as the chickens. They use TOKYO X, Kirishima Kogen, Iberian, and Kinkaton pork. They've spared no effort with the soup.\n\nDespite the long list of ingredients, it doesn't feel over-elaborate. By design it's unpretentious and elegant in a very Japanese way.\n\nThe thin, silky noodles are blended with several types of wheat flour. This includes Haru yo Koi, Haruyutaka, Sanuki no Yume, and Kitahonami. All you need to know is that these varieties of wheat flour are top-notch. Furthermore, the noodles use kansui (lye water) from Inner Mongolia and Okinawan sea salt.\n\nThis style of shoyu ramen is similar to what you get at Tokyo ramen shops like Muginae, Toybox and Yamaguchi. But there's no doubt that Iida's version is one of the best.\n\nSo the shoyu ramen is excellent. But it's the tsukemen (dipping ramen) that stole my heart. In it, the shio (salt) seasoning is radiant as the sun. Salt from Christmas Island, Kiribati is the protagonist.\n\nThere's also salt from Kochi, sun-dried salt from Oshima, and sea salt crystals from Niigata. They even add Okinawan sea salt to kelp and scallops to create a dashi. All together, this foundation is a harmonious symphony of salts.\n\nThe chicken flavors in the soup shine even more brightly than in the shoyu ramen.\n\nYou're treated to two types of noodles. The yellow-colored ones on the left are thick and slippery like typical tsukemen noodles. The ones on the right are almost like soba, with a stronger buckwheat flavor and graininess. Two separate noodles experiences!\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. Besides the golden colored broth, there's a separate bowl of tsukejiru. Think of tsukejiru as a light shoyu broth commonly paired with soba. Then comes the final act - a kombu (kelp) and katsuo (bonito) oil. This is meant to be poured directly over the remaining noodles.\n\nThe carefully extracted flavors in this oil reinforce a sense of Japanese elegance. Towards the end of the meal they'll also bring super soft slices of slow-cooked pork. You add these to the main soup, which makes it meatier.\n\nI haven't even mentioned the condiments - wasabi, ume (plum) and white negi (spring onions). Lastly, just like in the ramen, the cuts of pork chashu are excellent. I could literally write another essay about how they're prepared and seasoned. But I'll stop here.\n\nOn another note, Iida Shoten has created one of the best instant ramen I've ever tried. It's based off the shoyu ramen above:\n\nThere is no question that Iida Ramen delivers one of the finest ramen experiences in Japan. From the moment you sit down this fact is as clear as the tsukemen soup.\n\nOwner Iida-san is understandably a rock star in the ramen world. Many abroad may recognize him from the documentary Ramenheads. Inside, he takes the time to bow to every single customer.\n\nTheir ramen is priced higher than most Japan ramen shops. This is not to mention the travel costs associated with getting to Yugawara.\n\nBut nobody quite does it like Iida.",

    "content": "Haruchan Ramen (新橋はるちゃんラーメン) in Shimbashi is Michelin-recommended, and once you sit down to a bowl, you’ll understand why. The portions are huge, the bowls overflow on purpose, and the salty, oily finish will stick with you long after you leave.\n\nHaruchan’s base is pork and fish. The pork gives the broth its richness, while the fish adds a quieter note in the background.\n\nBut the real punch here comes from the seasoning: a salty shio with plenty of lard. It’s sharp, it’s oily, and cheeky.\n\nThe noodles are fantastic. They're big, high-water content noodles with a springy chew. They might remind you of something from Tohoku, like a hearty bowl in Yamagata or Fukushima.\n\nTechnically, Haruchan sits within the Chan-kei genre of ramen, but these noodles feel like they’re marching to their own beat.\n\n• Chashu pork: thick, savory, and satisfying.\n\n• Negi (spring onions): a sharp counterpoint to the oily broth.\n\n• Fu (wheat gluten): a cute pink-and-white star floating in the soup.\n\n• Menma (bamboo shoots): thinly sliced and refreshing.\n\nEverything works together to match the sheer size and intensity of the bowl.\n\nExpect to line up - there are only a few counter seats. And before you do, don’t forget to buy a ticket at the ticket machine.\n\nWhen you get your bowl, it will likely arrive filled to the brim, soup spilling slightly over the edge, as if the shop itself wants to make sure you’re not leaving hungry.\n\n• A salty, lard-rich shio broth unlike anything else in Shimbashi\n\n• Massive portions with overflowing bowls and thick, chewy noodles\n\n• A shop that feels like Tohoku and Tokyo ramen hybrid\n\n• Simple toppings that hit all the right notes",

    "content": "Gokan Ramen (五感) in Ikebukuro is reservation only. It’s a symphony of salt, chicken, and clam, performed in one of Tokyo’s most intimate ramen spaces.\n\nReservations open every Sunday at 10 a.m. on TableCheck for the following week, and they disappear in minutes. And honestly, it makes sense. This place delivers one of the most memorable shio bowls I’ve had in a long time.\n\nThe space itself has history. It’s the same location where Rokkandō, another famed ramen shop, once stood.\n\nLet’s start with the soup, because that’s where Gokan just hits another level. It’s salty - unapologetically so. But that salt isn’t just seasoning; it’s direction. It pushes the chicken and clam flavors forward, amplifying them until they practically sing.\n\nThe base combines Hinai chicken, Nagoya Cochin, and Daisen chicken, with Rausu kelp and Hokkaido scallops folded in for a natural, oceanic sweetness. The result? A broth that glows - clean, rich, and impossibly balanced.\n\nThe first sip feels warm and briny, but by the third, you realize how layered it is - like tasting sunlight through steam. I love salty ramen, but Gokan somehow makes salt itself taste elegant.\n\nYou won’t find an overload of toppings here. It’s all about quality. Slices of Kagoshima black pork and chicken thigh are low-temperature cooked, then lightly charcoal-grilled for that subtle smoky finish. Add in handmade dumplings, a silky seasoned egg, and that’s about it.\n\nIt’s restrained - but intentional. The toppings act more like background vocals to the soup’s solo performance.\n\nThe noodles, from Daisei Shokuhin, are a nice match.\n\nWith the reservation fee and all toppings, my total came to just over ¥2,500. But at a place like Gokan, you don’t hold back. You’ve set an alarm to book it, waited all week, and made the trip to Ikebukuro - might as well go all in.\n\nAnd I’m glad I did. Every extra topping felt like a nod to the effort it took to be there. But even if I’d ordered the simplest version, that broth alone would’ve made it worth it.\n\nGokan isn’t just a good shio ramen shop. It’s a reminder of what ramen can be when a chef treats it like art.\n\nMap Link",

    "title": "Is Ramen Unhealthy? An Experts Take",
    "content": "Is ramen unhealthy? Coming from someone who's eaten thousands of bowls, the answer may surprise you. Sodium amount, calories - we're covering it all!\n\nI (Frank from 5 AM Ramen) literally grew up on ramen and proudly eat it for a living. Therefore you will find a little ramen bias here.\n\nHowever, I can also provide some insight that only a regular ramen eater could. I'll even talk about ramen's effect on my personal health.\n\nWithout further ado, let's dive in!\n\nMost ramen from restaurants in Japan are about 450 - 600 calories. This is when you drink all the soup. If you're not drinking all the soup, the total is around 400 - 550 calories (shaving off 50+ calories).\n\nBut ramen is extremely diverse. No bowl is the same. The below three ramen styles and their differing calorie count illustrate this.\n\n1. Shio (Salt-Seasoned) Ramen - Lighter\n\nNoodles: 225 Calories\n\nToppings: 75 Calories\n\n2. Miso Ramen - Heavier\n\nNoodles: 280 Calories\n\nToppings: 100 Calories\n\n3. Jiro Style Ramen - Even Heavier\n\nNoodles: 600 calories\n\nToppings: 200 calories\n\nTOTAL: 1,600+ Calories*\n\n* some Jiro bowls go well past 2,000 calories\n\nIn summary, depending on the ramen style, calories can vary a great deal. In terms of soup, light and clear soups (e.g. shio) are not as calorific as murky, fatty soups (e.g. miso or tonkotsu).\n\nA cloudy pork bone soup will naturally have more calories than a transparent chicken bone and vegetable based one. Excluding bowls like the 2 Kilo Ramen Beast above, most of the calories in ramen actually come from the noodles!\n\nA regular portion of ramen noodles in Japan is around 130-180 grams. But it does depend. The noodles in tsukemen (dipping ramen), for example, usually start at 250 grams. But on average, we're still looking at 130-180 grams.\n\nBut this weight is BEFORE the noodles are boiled. After you boil 130 grams of fresh noodles, they balloon to about 203 grams. What I'm trying to say is that the noodles in ramen are the heftiest part of the meal.\n\nFurthermore, what makes ramen noodles so calorific is their sugar content. For every 100 grams of boiled noodles there's roughly 27 grams of carbs. This translates to 9 cubes of sugar (each 3 grams) for every 100 grams of noodles.\n\nIn other words, this is 20+ cubes of sugar coming from just the noodles every time you eat ramen. Note: pasta noodles have more calories (and sugar) than ramen noodles.\n\nFurthermore, pasta or ramen noodles don't have much nutritional value. In this sense, they're the most dangerous element in ramen. But what about sodium in ramen soup? We're also going to talk about my yearly health checkup at the very end!\n\nIn Western countries (especially in the US), people tend to focus on the sodium content in food. Since I eat ramen every day, people often ask, \"aren't you worried your sodium levels\"? In short, I'm not.\n\nJapanese food is quite salty - this includes ramen. Yet Japanese don't talk about salt content in the same cautionary way they do in the West. This is the same when it comes to MSG. Despite this lack of concern surrounding sodium, Japanese are among the healthiest people in the world.\n\nIn Korea, it's a similar story. Kimchi, psangem, you name it...a lot of Korean foods are high in sodium. Yet Koreans have a long life expectancy. The point is that sodium isn't as evil as its made out to be. Sugar (via ramen noodles) takes the crown in terms of heart disease risk and other issues.\n\nIn the same regard, there are many foods that have a ton of sodium in them that are unhealthier than ramen. This includes burritos and pizza, for example.\n\nWith this in mind, the sodium in ramen soup is the least of my concerns.\n\nA burger is approximately 375 calories or more. But if you toss French fries into the mix, you're adding another 325 calories. This said, a burger meal at a fast food restaurant puts you in 700 calorie territory.\n\nThe great thing about proper ramen is that it's a full meal. You don't need sides. In addition, there are again worse things you could be putting into your body than ramen.\n\nBut ramen is sometimes considered part of the \"greasy fast food\" category outside of Japan.\n\n1) Heavier, higher calorie styles like Tonkotsu Ramen and Spicy Miso Ramen dominate overseas menus (these flavors are easy to understand)\n\n2) Restaurant marketing in other countries pushes the idea that you should order fried dumplings or some side with your ramen (it's a dining experience)\n\nIn Japan, it's a different story. Lighter ramen styles are most common. Moreover, fried rice or fried dumplings are sometimes available as sides...but ramen shops aren't pushing combo meals as aggressively. They don't need to. Ramen shops in Japan are smaller and have less overhead costs.\n\nAgain, ramen by itself should be a full meal. While there are some heavy styles in Japan, lighter styles are most dominant. Take someone like me - I'd be in a lot more trouble if I ate burgers every day...\n\nThis ties into the calorie discussion earlier. First off, ramen soup can be nutritious. Many ramen shops don't just use chicken and pork bones. They often incorporate a lot of vegetables too. So ramen soup can have fiber, vitamin K1, vitamin C, vitamin B6, etc.\n\nWe already talked about noodles. There's unfortunately not much nutrition there.\n\nWhen it comes to toppings, pork slices and/or egg are normally the source of protein. Pork is often the fattier side and is therefore something to watch out for.\n\nBamboo shoots (menma) and spring onions (negi) usually make up the vegetable toppings. They're good for you! Spring onions have a ton of Vitamin C and Calcium. Bamboo shoots have little calories but have a lot of fiber.\n\nWhile ramen isn't a plate of vegetables, there are some styles that feature a lot of vegetable toppings. In conclusion, ramen soup and toppings do have plenty of nutritional value.\n\nI do a health checkup every single year. Last year I ate about 500 bowls (more than normal). I still passed my health checkup with flying colors.\n\nI'm not encouraging anyone to eat as much ramen as I do. I'm just stating that ramen isn't the devil that it's sometimes made out to be.\n\nAlso, I've found that doing these things have helped me a lot:\n\nOccasional breaks from meals - if I eat 8 bowls of ramen over two days, I might eat only a salad the following day\n\nStaying super active - I walk and bike everywhere\n\nNot drinking all the soup in ramen and drinking a lot of water\n\nNot drinking soda often (I get plenty of sugar already from ramen noodles)\n\nThese things are not exactly revolutionary. But they work. I'm not some freak of nature who can eat anything without consequences.\n\nLike many people, my weight has fluctuated over the years. When I used to work in finance I basically didn't move all day. I was HUGE. I would exercise but nothing would seem to come off. But I definitely wasn't heeding the above things. Balance is everything - especially knowing how much sugar is in ramen noodles!\n\nTo sum it all up, there are certain types of ramen that aren't the best for you. But looking at calories and nutritional value, there are definitely much worse foods out there. I'm living proof that regular ramen eating is doable with a balanced lifestyle. Just ask my doctor!\n\nWant to taste delicious ramen in mini portions? Book our Ultimate Ramen Tasting Tour below!",

    "title": "Ramen Jiro Mita Honten: The Original Branch That Started It All",
    "content": "If there’s one ramen shop in Japan that’s bigger than ramen itself, it’s Ramen Jiro. At Mita Honten (their main store) is where it all began.\n\nFounded in 1968, Ramen Jiro (ラーメン二郎) didn’t just launch a new bowl of ramen. It launched an entire subculture. For some, Jiro is ramen. For others, it’s something else entirely.\n\nEither way, every serious ramen fan should experience it at least once, especially at this legendary flagship shop.\n\nLet’s start here: Ramen Jiro is not for the faint of heart.\n\nHuge, almost cartoonishly large portions\n\nA rich, salty broth that blends pork bone (tonkotsu) and soy sauce (shoyu) - some shops have a more emulsified soup than others\n\nPiles of toppings like cabbage, bean sprouts, pork, garlic, and pork fat\n\nIt’s not a “refined” ramen. It’s primal. Loud. Sweaty. And for many, that’s the appeal.\n\nRamen Jiro first opened in 1968 in Meguro, but the shop later moved to the Mita neighborhood of Tokyo in the early 1970s.\n\nThere’s a funny origin story about the name. When they moved, the sign painter accidentally used different kanji for “Jiro” (二郎 instead of 次郎). Instead of fixing it, the founder, Takumi Yamada, kept it. That mistake became the brand.\n\nFrom there, Jiro’s legend grew. Today, there are about 40 official Jiro branches across Japan. These are known as “direct line” Jiro shops, meaning they have a direct connection to the original.\n\nBeyond that, there’s a massive world of “Jiro-inspired” ramen shops. These places mimic the style. That is - giant portions, thick noodles, and a rich broth. But they aren’t part of the official Jiro family.\n\nRamen Jiro Mita Honten (the flagship) is more than just the original - it’s sacred ground for Jiro fans. Located in Minato-ku, Tokyo, it’s a small, no-frills shop with just 13 counter seats. But the lines can stretch down the block, even before they open.\n\nInside, you’ll find a red counter, a slightly chaotic atmosphere, and if you’re lucky, the original founder’s presence. He's known to still drop in.\n\nThe pork chashu slices here aren't as fatty as other branches. But they are more intensely shoyu (soy sauce)-flavored.\n\nI’ll be honest - my relationship with Ramen Jiro is complicated.\n\nOn one hand, it’s something every ramen head needs to try. The thick noodles are incredible, and the broth is dangerously addictive - saltiness and fattiness included.\n\nOn the other hand...I’m not a huge fan of the “walk on eggshells” feeling you sometimes get inside. The staff can be gruff, and the whole experience feels like a test if you’re not a regular.\n\nI don’t go to Jiro often. But when I do, it’s usually one of the branches I’ve grown to like over the years - Kanda Jinbocho, or Meguro, for example.\n\nStill, there’s something about Mita Honten that feels different. Even if it’s not my favorite branch, there’s a certain gravity to sitting at the original counter and digging into a bowl that started it all.\n\nOrdering at Jiro can be intimidating, especially for first-timers. Here’s a breakdown to help you avoid missteps:\n\nAs you wait in line, you’ll eventually get to a ticket machine. Cash in, push the button for you ramen. We'd recommend the “ Small Ramen” (小ラーメン), or “Sho Butairi Ramen” (小豚入りラーメン), which includes extra pork. Trust us, the \"small\" portion is plenty.\n\nStaff will guide you when and where to sit. Don’t rush this. They run a tight ship.\n\nBe Ready for “The Call”\n\nJust before your bowl is served, the staff will look at you and ask something like, “Ninniku iremasu ka?” (Do you want garlic?)\n\nThis is your cue to customize the free toppings by uttering the below words:\n\n\"Yasai\" - Extra veggies (bean sprouts + cabbage)\n\n\"Ninniku\" - Raw minced garlic\n\n\"Abura\" - Pork back fat\n\n\"Karame\" - Extra seasoning (tare)\n\n“Ninniku” (just garlic)\n\n“Yasai Mashi” (extra veggies)\n\n“Yasai Mashi Mashi” (a mountain of veg)\n\n“Zenbu Mashi” (everything extra - be careful!)\n\nIf you want to skip toppings: say “Ninniku nashi” (no garlic), or “Subete futsuu” (everything normal).\n\nTip: If it’s your first time, keep it simple. “Ninniku sukoshi” (a little garlic) is a safe bet.\n\nFlip your bowl: Use your chopsticks to bring noodles to the top (known as “tenchi gaeshi”) to prevent sogginess.\n\nDon’t linger: Finish quickly and leave. No chatting after.\n\nStart small: You can ask for “men sukuname” (less noodles) when ordering, especially if you’re not sure you can finish. It's otherwise a lot - even the \"small!\"\n\nRamen Jiro isn’t for everyone - and that’s the point. It's extreme. It’s loud. It’s rough around the edges. And yet, it’s one of the most iconic ramen experiences in Japan.\n\nIf you’re a ramen lover, you owe it to yourself to visit Mita Honten at least once. Just don’t expect a typical bowl of ramen. Expect a challenge. A little chaos.\n\nAnd if you survive the mountain of noodles and walk out into the Tokyo streets full and victorious - you’ll understand why Ramen Jiro has earned its cult status.",

    "content": "Ramen Hiiki (らーめん飛粋) in Kamata brings a different angle to Yokohama-style Ie-Kei - a style known for its rich pork-and-chicken broth, chewy noodles, and that unmistakable pork bone funk that hits you before you even sit down.\n\nHiiki keeps the core framework, but steers it toward something cleaner, more polished, and more modern.\n\nWhere a lot of Ie-Kei shops lean into brute force, Hiiki opts for balance. Their pork-and-chicken broth still has that signature salty, creamy character. But the edges are softer, the flavors more controlled.\n\nThe chicken oil (鶏油) is a big part of that. It adds aroma and richness without weighing the soup down. Instead of coating your tongue like some of the heavier bowls do, it glides. It's iekei - just one wearing a freshly ironed shirt.\n\nI’ll be honest: on some days, I actually crave the messier, funkier side of iekei. That punch of pork bone, that unruly energy. Hiiki doesn’t go in that direction. But within the “refined” lane they’ve chosen, they execute it extremely well.\n\nHiiki follows the standard lineup:\n\nBut then comes something very un-iekei: super-rare, soft sous-vide chashu pork. It's tender, modern, almost silky - a clear departure from the old-school, firmer slices you often see at Yokohama-heavy shops.\n\nIt fits Hiiki’s more polished style, even if traditionalists may blink twice.\n\nOn the counter, you’ll find the classics condiments - fresh garlic, ginger, and doubanjiang (broad bean paste).\n\nHiiki shows that iekei ramen doesn’t always have to be chaotic, loud, or aggressively rich. Their version is balanced, aromatic, and decidedly modern.\n\nOn days when you want a cleaner, smoother interpretation of iekei, Hiiki absolutely hits the spot. On days when you want pure pork bone mayhem - well, that’s when you head to one of the rowdier Yokohama shops.",

The broth sings with the delicate sweetness of scallops, complemented by a base of chicken and prawn.

This gentle spice balances the broth’s sweetness and creates a fantastic flavor profile.\n\nThe toppings are equally impressive. You’re greeted with artfully arranged smoky duck slices, tender pork dumplings, juicy bamboo shoots, and a perfectly seared scallop. Paired with the shop’s in-house, straight flat noodles, this is ramen elevated to an art form.\n\nFor those lucky enough to visit when it’s available, the limited-time kani miso (crab paste) ramen is an excellent second option. The soup, made with rich crab paste derived from crab innards, delivers a luxurious depth of flavor that lingers long after your last sip.\n\nIt’s sweet, savory, and indulgent, perfectly paired with the same handcrafted noodles that define the shop’s signature bowls.\n\nWhile the scallop ramen is a delicate symphony, the kani miso ramen is more of a bold jazz piece—dynamic and unforgettable. I realize kani miso might not be for everyone, but if you’re feeling adventurous, it’s absolutely worth a try!\n\nMugi no Yoake is a ramen shop that clearly takes pride in every detail, from its carefully crafted broths to its handmade noodles. Whether you’re savoring the scallop ramen or exploring a seasonal bowl, you’re sure to leave satisfied and eager to return.\n\nIf you’re in Kyoto and want a bowl of ramen that’s truly special, Mugi no Yoake should be high on your list.",

    "content": "Akimoto Ramen Yokohama (麺処 秋もと) is a real treat. Down a narrow alley under the railway tracks, this cozy spot delivers a shoyu ramen that’s heavy on chicken chiyu (oil), yet never overpowers the star of the show: katsuo (bonito).\n\nBe prepared to wait - Akimoto in Aobadai, Yokohama, is one of the area’s highest-ranked ramen shops.\n\nYou line up, buy a ticket, and claim your spot. Akimoto isn’t flashy, but it feels purposeful - exactly what a high-level ramen experience should be.\n\nIn their signature ramen, the soy sauce seasoning is bold - salty, sweet, even a touch sour. The broth is built on chicken stock with a generous dose of fragrant chiyu (chicken oil) and a backbone of katsuo. Despite the dark oil sheen, the soup doesn’t feel overwhelming.\n\nIt's bright, clean, and distinctly katsuo-forward, with chicken notes walking gently in the background.\n\nThe thick are firm and slippery and more chewy than frizzy. Each bite lifts enough soy sauce and oil to coat your lips without muddying your palate.\n\nToppings hit the mark, too: melt-in-your-mouth pork chashu, well-executed shrimp-and-pork wontons, and vibrant green negi. They lean on the classic side, but they’re never boring.\n\nFor shoyu ramen lovers craving bold chicken oil, fragrant fish, and firm noodles in the right proportion, Akimoto Ramen Yokohama delivers with character.\n\nSometimes the best bowls are the ones that quietly get it right.",

    "title": "Top 5 Namba Ramen Shops You Need to Try",
    "content": "If you’re in Osaka, chances are you’ll end up in Namba. It’s one of the city’s busiest hubs - shopping, nightlife, neon, and of course...ramen. So what’s the best ramen in Namba?\n\nHere are five Namba ramen shops I’ve personally visited that stand out, each offering something different.\n\nIf you want to better understand the roots of Osaka ramen, visit Jouroku (麺屋 丈六) . They serve Takaida-style ramen, a local shoyu-based style with a rich history. The broth here is medium-rich, built around chicken bones and soy sauce, with a seasoning that really leans into the soy.\n\nJouroku is an institution. It's a shop that’s been carrying the torch for Osaka-style shoyu ramen since 2008. It’s as straightforward as it is comforting.\n\nnext shikaku (next□) offers a much more modern, upscale ramen experience. It’s produced by the same group behind Zagin, and the shop has projected artwork on the walls, creating a swanky vibe.\n\nTheir ramen is oyster-based It's rich, briny, and layered. You can also order it as tsukemen (dipping ramen), paired with some of the thickest noodles you’ll find in the city. For oyster lovers, this is non-negotiable.\n\nNaniwa Menjiro (なにわ麺次郎) is hidden inside the Osaka Metro, past the ticket wickets. This makes it tricky to find but also helps keep the lines shorter. The shop offers two base soups: one chicken-based, and one shellfish-based.\n\nI usually go for the shellfish ramen. It's beautifully presented and has a refined, layered flavor. It's light and aromatic. This is one of those ramen shops that makes you feel like you’ve stumbled upon a secret.\n\nA little more under the radar, Men-no-Yoji (麺のようじ) serves both ramen and tsukemen. Both feature chicken-based broths with a gentle, natural sweetness, though the tsukemen leans richer and thicker in flavor.\n\nThe bowls are bright, well-balanced, and the friendly staff make the experience even better.\n\nWalking into Yuaitei (友愛亭) feels like stepping into a boxing gym. The walls are covered in the signatures of famous boxers, and every ramen on the menu is named after a boxing move.\n\nThere’s the Straight Right, a darker soy sauce ramen. The Kamisori Punch (pictured) is a lighter shoyu that cuts clean. And for those who want something with knockout weight, there’s the “Heavy” ramen. It's Mike Tyson-inspired and heavier on the soy sauce. This is ramen with personality, and it hits as hard as its names suggest.\n\nFrom classic Osaka-style shoyu to oyster tsukemen in a stylish setting, these five shops represent the best of what Namba has to offer. Whether you’re after tradition, refinement, or a knockout punch, Namba ramen delivers.",

    "title": "Men Kurai – Ramen Heavyweight in Hamamatsucho",
    "content": "Hamamatsucho is loaded with ramen shops, but Men Kurai (MENクライ) sits confidently at the top of the rankings. It doesn't take long to see why this place stands out.\n\nTheir signature bowl is a shoyu ramen built on unpasteurized soy sauce. The broth is meaty but layered. Chicken, pork, and fish (including dried bonito and dried mackerel) all come together for depth and balance.\n\nToppings hit all the right notes: proper pork chashu, a naruto (fish cake) swirl, fresh spinach, negi (spring onions), and a soft-boiled egg if you go all in. Classic, but beautifully executed. But what truly makes this bowl unforgettable are the noodles.\n\nThese aren’t just thick - they’re colossal. Ridiculously wide, chewy, and doughy, unlike anything I’ve seen at another ramen shop. These hand-pressed noodles are practically a meal by themselves.\n\nIf anything, the soupless ramen (abura soba) showcases those noodles even better. With no broth to distract, they’re front and center.\n\nThe base is soy sauce again, but lighter, with pork lard binding it all together. A subtle spiciness creeps in too, giving the dish a flavor profile that almost recalls Southeast Asian stir-fried noodles, like pad see ew.\n\nThe toppings seal the deal - raw garlic, chopped negi, chashu, dumplings (a house specialty), and a soft egg if you go all in. Bold, slightly spicy, and utterly addictive.\n\nMen Kurai is operated by the same company behind Chuukasoba Waka in Shinagawa, and it shows. Their noodle-making “laboratory” has clearly been busy. Crafting noodles like these isn’t just about skill - it’s experimentation and obsession.\n\nThe line here is steady but not overwhelming. Unlike some Tokyo heavyweights, you don’t need to block off half your day to get a seat. And yet, Men Kurai consistently dominates the Hamamatsucho ramen charts. This is a serious feat in an area packed with strong contenders.\n\nIf you’re exploring Hamamatsucho, make sure Men Kurai is on your list. Whether you go for the hearty shoyu ramen or the spicy, almost pad see ew–like abura soba, you’ll leave impressed.",

    "content": "Hamamatsucho is overflowing with ramen shops, but Hachan Ramen (ハちゃんラーメン) deserves your attention. It’s got depth in the broth, toppings that shine, and some of the best chashu you’ll find in town.\n\nThe soup is like an orchestra - chicken laying down the steady rhythm, pork adding bass, and seafood bringing the high notes. On top, a sheen of chicken oil (鶏油) ties it all together, giving the broth both richness and lift.\n\nOrder the special and you’ll even get a slice of duck breast - a rare instrument in the ramen world that adds its own distinctive timbre.\n\nThe chashu here is the showstopper. Multiple cuts of pork, each prepared differently, create a full performance: smoky edges that hit hard, melt-in bites that fade gently, and low-temperature slices that add subtlety.\n\nIn the “特製 (special)” bowl, the curtain rises even higher with duck breast chashu, chicken chashu, and a perfectly seasoned egg.\n\nThe chef at Hachan once trained at Honda in Akihabara, one of Tokyo’s most respected ramen shops. You can sense the lineage in the layered broth and the confident use of chicken oil.\n\nBut Hachan isn’t simply playing Honda’s sheet music. It’s taken those foundations and composed something of its own - one that feels approachable, distinct, and very Hamamatsucho.\n\nBowls generally range from ¥1,000–¥1,350. For this level of ingredient quality - pork prepared multiple ways, duck breast, and a seafood-accented broth - Hachan delivers remarkable value.\n\nYou’re getting a performance worthy of a bigger stage at a neighborhood price.\n\nHachan offers more than a good bowl of ramen. It’s a layered broth that plays like a symphony, chashu that steals the spotlight, and a story rooted in one of Tokyo’s greats. Right in Hamamatsucho, it’s an unmissable stop for ramen fans.",

    "content": "Tokyo’s Shimbashi is overflowing with ramen shops, but Menya Sugo (麺屋 周郷) has quickly made a name for itself. This tiny five-seater specializes in tsukemen - dipping ramen - with a broth that’s as rich as it is refined. Pork, chicken, and fish all come together in a soup that’s silky and full of depth, with smoky notes from the fish rounding it out.\n\nWhen I visited, it was the height of Tokyo’s August summer. The wait? About 60 minutes. The heat? Brutal. I was melting in line, but Menya Sugo’s friendly staff softened the blow. They even provide umbrellas to shield you from the sun.\n\nAs you inch closer to the door, you’ll be asked to buy a ticket from the ticket machine (with English options), and then hand it over through a small service window. The chef pops his head out like a station attendant on the Yamanote Line. A charming touch before the main event.\n\nThe noodles here are special. Made in collaboration with Kanno Seimenjo, one of Japan’s most respected noodle makers, they use Fukuoka-grown Komugi no Shin wheat for a clean, springy bite. You can choose small, medium, or large. What you see here - 200g - is actually the medium size. It's perfect for soaking up the broth without overdoing it.\n\nThe soup is pressure-cooked with pork, chicken, and fish, layered with dried fish, shiitake, and kombu. It’s smooth like velvet on the palate, with sharp edges of umami fish that cut through the creaminess.\n\nFor the full experience, order the Tokusei (all toppings). You’ll get three different cuts of meat:\n\n• Roast pork chashu – tender, marinated slices.\n\n• Grilled chicken – lightly charred for smokiness.\n\n• Soy-marinated minced pork – punchy and savory.\n\nEach topping brings something unique.\n\nIn addition, Menya Sugo stands out because of its service. Despite long lines, staff treat every guest with warmth. The umbrellas, the friendly guidance at the ticket machine, and even the little ticket window moment all make the experience feel special.\n\nMenya Sugo in Shimbashi is the place for tsukemen. It's also the the kind of place where one bowl erases any memory of the wait. The noodles are top-tier, the broth is comforting, and the toppings deliver variety and punch.\n\nFurthermore, Iit’s a reminder of why Shimbashi is one of Tokyo’s most exciting ramen neighborhoods.",

    "content": "Wagyu ramen? Yes, it’s real. And at Wagyu Ramen GOKU in Shibuya, it might just ruin you for all other beef ramen.\n\nThe soup here is made entirely from beef bones. No chicken, no pork - just beef. But the magic is in the layering. The chef blends in special beef oils, including one rendered from the cow’s stomach, which adds a subtle sweetness.\n\nThe result is thick and gravy-like. Every sip screams beef, but with a surprising complexity that keeps you coming back.\n\nBeef bone ramen is actually rare in Japan. Outside of Tottori - a prefecture famous for its gyukotsu (beef bone) ramen - most ramen shops stick with chicken or pork bases. That’s why GOKU stands out even more in Tokyo.\n\nThe toppings at GOKU are all about showcasing Wagyu in different forms:\n\n• Sirloin slices grilled until they practically melt on your tongue.\n\n• Smoky thigh meat, charred for a punch of flavor.\n\n• Soy-marinated beef, deep and bold with every bite.\n\nAll this is tied together with a finishing drizzle of beef oil tare. This isn’t just ramen with beef toppings. It’s Wagyu showcased in three dimensions.\n\nFor noodles, GOKU works with Kanno Seimenjo, one of Japan’s top noodle makers. The premium wheat flour gives them a perfect chewy bite, sturdy enough to stand up to the rich broth.\n\nA handful of bitter greens rounds out the bowl, cutting through the richness and balancing everything out.\n\nRamen in Tokyo rarely goes all-in on beef. That’s what makes Wagyu Ramen GOKU special. From soup to toppings, it’s pure Wagyu - a bowl that leaves no doubt what it’s about.\n\nIf you’re in Shibuya and craving something bold, indulgent, and unforgettable, GOKU is the place. The head chef brings serious pedigree too, having honed his craft at ramen powerhouses like Menya Musashi and Kikanbo.",
